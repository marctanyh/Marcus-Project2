Code and Code Design
--
What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
  - I think I might proceed with future projects with a depth approach as opposed to a breadth approach. I think I might have overeached with thsis project. 

What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
  - I am quite proud of myslef for getting MVCs now. It seemed like such a big thing not to long ago. I think if there is any future takeaway it would be to not get to worked up about getting things on the first try. Code and learn, also dont be afraid to scrap all the old code and start again if when there are ways things could be done better 

For each, please include code examples.

Code snippet up to 20 lines.
Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

WDI Unit 2 Post Mortem
--
What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
  - I think learning to push on ahead even when I have not grasped on the current topic might have been more beneficial to me overall 
  
What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
  - Fatalism and defeatism
  
How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
  - I think I have gotten used to the way things are run now. I feel like the instruction and overall class direction has been fair.
